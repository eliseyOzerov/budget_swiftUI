### Budget

My attempt at a budgeting app using SwiftUI.

Users can add transactions, budgets and savings goals and autosave budget leftovers. The data is saved locally using Realm Swift. There's currently no user authentication.

From the experience of working with SwiftUI on this app, I can confidently say that I will not continue working with SwiftUI for now, also meaning I won't update this repository once my original goals are achieved.
